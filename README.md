## Challenge 1: PCOS
### Context: 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to release eggs regularly. While the exact cause of PCOS is still unknown, early diagnosis, treatment and weight loss may reduce the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
### The data:
1. Dataset 1: Accessible via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayamoheddine/pcos-dataset/data  
44 different features with more than 500 records. Such features include pimples, hair growth, cycles, vitamin d3, etc. 
2. Dataset 2: Accessible via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasadbobby/pcosdata  
541 observations with 18 features, including demographic information such as age, weight, and height, as well as medical history, blood tests, and physical characteristics of the patients. The dataset also includes the results of an ultrasound examination(endometrium size), which is commonly used to diagnose PCOS. Each observation in the dataset represents a patient who has been diagnosed with PCOS.
### The goal:
Create a model to predict the diagnosis of a patient based on its clinical information.
